-----------  SELECT TAG HTML ----------------
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.

The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.

The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list.

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!
